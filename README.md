# Superstore Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)


This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) notebook for the Superstore dataset. The dataset contains information about sales and customer data for a retail store.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis can be found on Kaggle: [Superstore Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/asraimran/superstore-eda-matplotlib-seaborn)

## Notebook

The notebook [Superstore_EDA.ipynb](https://www.kaggle.com/code/asraimran/superstore-eda-matplotlib-seaborn) contains the Python code and detailed analysis for exploring the Superstore dataset. The notebook is created using Jupyter Notebook and includes visualizations created with Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries.

## Requirements

To run the notebook locally, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- Python (version 3.7 or higher)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install these libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install jupyter pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter notebook `Superstore_EDA.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
3. Execute each cell in the notebook to perform the analysis step by step.

Feel free to explore the notebook and adapt the analysis to your specific needs. Happy data exploration!
